Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.
Cameron.	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.	That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...	Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.	That's because it's such a nice one.
That's because it's such a nice one.	Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.	Where?
You got something on your mind?	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?	Tons
"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."	I was?
I was?	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...	Then that's all you had to say.
Then that's all you had to say.	But
But	You always been this selfish?
"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""	No...
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
What crap?	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
What good stuff?	"The ""real you""."
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"	No
No	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow	Let's go.
She okay?	I hope so.
They do to!	They do not!
Did you change your hair?	No.
No.	You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
Who?	Joey.
Great	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.	Is he oily or dry?
Is he oily or dry?	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?	I did.
It's more	Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?	Hopefully.
"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."	Queen Harry?
Queen Harry?	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
Hi, Joey.	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.	Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?	What do you think?
What do you think?	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.	What's normal?
What's normal?	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.	Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.	You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.	Like you care.
Like you care.	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?	What?
What?	In 9th.  For a month
In 9th.  For a month	Why?
Why?	He was, like, a total babe
He was, like, a total babe	But you hate Joey
But you hate Joey	Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.	As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
You did what?	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But	"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself	Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.	I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
Let go!	You set me up.
You set me up.	I just wanted --
I just wanted --	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?	No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?	It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.	Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	What if she never starts dating?
What if she never starts dating?	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?
And where're you going?	If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.	Otherwise known as an orgy?
Otherwise known as an orgy?	"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.	Daddy, no!
Daddy, no!	Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
Why?	Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --	The prom?  Kat has a date?
The prom?  Kat has a date?	No, but
No, but	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?	"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?	Never

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?	Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
So they tell me...	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?	North, actually.  How'd you   ?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?	I was kidding. People actually live there?

How many people go here?	Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --	You burn, you pine, you perish?
You burn, you pine, you perish?	Who is she?
Who is she?	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it	Why not?
Why not?	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.	He always have that shit-eating grin?
He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?	You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?	He seems like he thrives on danger
He seems like he thrives on danger	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?	That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.	I thought you hated those people.
I thought you hated those people.	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.	Will Bogey get bent?
Will Bogey get bent?	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
It's a lung cancer issue	Her favorite uncle
Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.	No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.	Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.	Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?	She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?	Sure
Sure	Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?	She kissed me.
She kissed me.	Where?
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
Where ya goin?	Away.
Away.	Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
Yeah	What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.	You just said
You just said	You need money to take a girl out
You need money to take a girl out	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.	How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.	Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.	I'm on it
I'm on it	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price	What?
What?	A hundred bucks a date.
A hundred bucks a date.	Forget it.
Forget it.	Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?	Do what?
Do what?	Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.	Are you lost?
Are you lost?	Nope - just came by to chat
Nope - just came by to chat	We don't chat.
We don't chat.	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?	Does this conversation have a purpose?
Does this conversation have a purpose?	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*	You and Verona?

He always look so	Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.	Just a little.
What's this?	An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.	William would never have gone to a state school.
William would never have gone to a state school.	William didn't even go to high school
William didn't even go to high school	That's never been proven
That's never been proven	Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?	Does it matter?
Does it matter?	"If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
You think this'll work?	No fear.
What'd he say?	Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.	I didn't have a choice.
I didn't have a choice.	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.	You didn't
You didn't	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.	Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway	You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.	Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?	Who?
Who?	William - he asked me to meet him here.
William - he asked me to meet him here.	Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.	My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then	Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?	I know a lot more than that

I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.	And why would I do that?
And why would I do that?	Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...	You -- covered in my vomit.

I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.	Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?	That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what you want, isn't it?	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.

Why?	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.	Like you could find one
Like you could find one	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?

Who?	Dorsey.
Dorsey.	I hate him.
I hate him.	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.	"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"	I thought you were above all that
I thought you were above all that	You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!	What?
And I'm in control of it.	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?	Busy
Busy	Were you in jail?
Were you in jail?	Maybe.
Maybe.	No, you weren't
No, you weren't	Then why'd you ask?
Then why'd you ask?	Why'd you lie?
I should do this.	Do what?
Do what?	This.
Start a band?	My father wouldn't approve of that that
My father wouldn't approve of that that	You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.	Who?
Who?	BIANCA
BIANCA	No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	I heard there was a poetry reading.
I heard there was a poetry reading.	You 're so --
You 're so --	Pleasant?
Wholesome.	Unwelcome.
Unwelcome.	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.	Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.	So what did I have an effect on ?
So what did I have an effect on ?	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.	C'mon.  It's not that bad
C'mon.  It's not that bad	Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.	You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?	Maybe.
The Partridge Family?	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.	Good call.
Good call.	So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?	I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?
So what's your excuse?	Acting the way we do.
Acting the way we do.	Yes
Yes	I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.	So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?	Something like that
Something like that	Then you screwed up
Then you screwed up	How?
How?	You never disappointed me.
You up for it?	For. . . ?
State trooper?	Fallacy.
Fallacy.	The duck?
The duck?	Hearsay.
Hearsay.	I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.	I hate peas.
I hate peas.	No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.

What?	No one else knows
No one else knows	You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?	Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?	You know what I mean
You know what I mean	No.
No.	No what?
No what?	No, I won't go with you
No, I won't go with you	Why not?
Why not?	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?	You tell me.
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	Answer the question, Patrick
Answer the question, Patrick	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?	It's just something I had.  You know
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
Oh huh	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .	What?
What?	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!	It wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that.	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?	I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Because I like to torture you.
Because I like to torture you.	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?	Don ' t you even dare. . .

This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?	Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS	Then tell them I had a seizure.
Then tell them I had a seizure.	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?	I thought you were punishing me.
I thought you were punishing me.	Why can't we agree on this?
Why can't we agree on this?	Because you're making decisions for me.
Because you're making decisions for me.	As a parent, that's my right
As a parent, that's my right	So what I want doesn't matter?
So what I want doesn't matter?	You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?	No, Daddy.
No, Daddy.	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	Parts of it.
Parts of it.	Which parts?
Which parts?	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.	Bianca did what?
Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?	No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.	When I go?
When I go?	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?	"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.
Hi.	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?	Yeah.  I guess.
You think?	Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?	Right.
Right.	Kat a fan, too?
Kat a fan, too?	Yeah...
Say it	What?
What?	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.	So Dorsey can get the girl?
So Dorsey can get the girl?	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?	We're your guys.
What?!	Good enough.
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"	Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?	Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.	I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
Sweet love, renew thy force!	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.	With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
Touch of the flu.	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?	What's to discuss?
What's to discuss?	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.	See you next week!
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?	Tumescent!
Tumescent!	You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?	Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap	Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
Your daughters went to the prom.	Did I have anything to say about it?
Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.	That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child...	We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?	I am, Your Eminence
I am, Your Eminence	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.	Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.	Your life, and that of others!
Your life, and that of others!	If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...	The Judgment is ours!
The Judgment is ours!	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.	I know.
I know.	I haven't given you much of a life.
I haven't given you much of a life.	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...	Are we going to argue?
Are we going to argue?	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...	I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.	Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
I don't want you to wait for me.	That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
You don't usually ask.	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...	They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me...	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.	May I ask by whom?
May I ask by whom?	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.	Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.	Appointment to what?
Appointment to what?	Viceroy of the West Indies.
Viceroy of the West Indies.	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
There'll be a time.	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.	This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
Father...	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...	No?
No?	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.	I'm not bargaining!
I'm not bargaining!	Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.	What...?  Do I have so many already?
What...?  Do I have so many already?	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.	Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.	Look out of that window.
What do you see?	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...	All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?	Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell the Chief we thank him.	Chief knows.
Chief knows.	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
Thousands.	Why?
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says -- he has a God.	... and also to bring medicine.
... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
Chief says...	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?	He understands.
He understands.	Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!	You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.	You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!	That's what it says.
That's what it says.	How did you manage it?
How did you manage it?	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.	How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain?	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...	Esdras is a Jew.
Esdras is a Jew.	So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...	Father Marchena!
Father Marchena!	Passion is something one cannot control!
Passion is something one cannot control!	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!
Colon!	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies!	Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.	How long?
How long?	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.	You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.	I knew you would.
I knew you would.	New worlds create new people.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
Oh?  So you are a new man?	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
What did they say about Granada before today?	That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."	A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.	Thank you.
Thank you.	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?	We don't need to know.
We don't need to know.	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?	You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...	God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...	And what do you think Mendez?
And what do you think Mendez?	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.	Come over here.
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
What's he doing?	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.	We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!	Six days ago, yes.
Six days ago, yes.	You must be mad...!
You must be mad...!	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!	You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?	We're lost!
We're lost!	The land is there.  I know it!
The land is there.  I know it!	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?	You bloody...
You bloody...	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!	You tell that to them!
You tell that to them!	You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?	Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?	He must be replaced.
He must be replaced.	And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.	Then why?
Then why?	Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.	Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?	He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
Where are we going?	I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.	You bring the cigarettes?
You bring the cigarettes?	Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.	I was all of these.
I was all of these.	Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.	What about Oleg?
What about Oleg?	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.	No, he is here.  Shit...
No, he is here.  Shit...	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?	Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.	What's your cut?  How much?
What's your cut?  How much?	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.	No.  No way.
No.  No way.	But it's...
But it's...	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.	This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.	What else do you need?
What else do you need?	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.	Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.	Your mother was blind?
Your mother was blind?	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.	Back in the Czech Republic?
Back in the Czech Republic?	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.	Can I see your back?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.	Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	I will if they don't send me back.
I will if they don't send me back.	They won't until this is over.
Are you married?	Divorced.
Divorced.	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.	So...the station is empty?
So...the station is empty?	Yeah.  This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
Yes, I considered it.	Did you ever turn tricks before?
Did you ever turn tricks before?	No.
No.	What about back home?
What about back home?	No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	So you were never a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?	What are you asking me?
What are you asking me?	I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	I know.
I know.	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?	They're not gonna send you right back.
They're not gonna send you right back.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.	I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend?	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.	If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.	I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.	Right.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.	I'll make some for us.
I'll make some for us.	I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?	Pouring it out!
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?	I don't want to drag you down with me.
I don't want to drag you down with me.	Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.	Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
It was my decision, not his.	Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.	Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.	Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin?	Who do you think, Chief?!
Who do you think, Chief?!	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.	What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'	I let her take a shower.
I let her take a shower.	A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?	No!  Nothing happened.
No!  Nothing happened.	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her?	Okay.  But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.	End my career?
End my career?	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.	But Chief?  Over this??
But Chief?  Over this??	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.	What was that, Korfin?
What was that, Korfin?	I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.	You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?	Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic.	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I'm gonna propose.	When?
When?	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.	You ready?
What's he looking for?	A timer.
Where is she?	Takin' a bath.
Takin' a bath.	Any I.D.?
Any I.D.?	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Yeah.	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.	Stay with her.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What's wrong?	We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?	No.
No.	Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.	Describe him.
Describe him.	Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
No, what is it?	Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
Watch the news?	Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, I musta missed it.	Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.	Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.	Nah, why should you?
Nah, why should you?	I don't even watch TV.
I don't even watch TV.	Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
Pretty.	Hmmmm.
Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.	Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her?	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.	This isn't homicide school.
This isn't homicide school.	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.	You're Polish?
You're Polish?	My folks are.
My folks are.	Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?	You got any better ideas?
You got any better ideas?	Mind if I ride along with you?
Mind if I ride along with you?	This has nothing to do with your fire.
This has nothing to do with your fire.	But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.	I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.	Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty?	I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.	So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.	Of course.
Of course.	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?	I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.	Is that all there is?
Why not?	Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.	You wanna talk to her alone?
You wanna talk to her alone?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What would your girlfriend think of that?
What would your girlfriend think of that?	I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.	My point exactly.
My point exactly.	I'm serious here.
I'm serious here.	So am I.
So am I.	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?	You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.	Hey.  I'm a professional.
Hey.  I'm a professional.	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.	Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.	Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.	But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?	You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
So...who's Nicky?	What do you want?
What do you want?	Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.	What's your accomplishment.
What's your accomplishment.	I kill someone famous.

Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!
Sit down!	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!	Good idea!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!	Cut!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?	Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!

I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!	Be quiet.  Watch.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.	Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.	Credit?

Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.	Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?
Clean?	Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.	But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.	He knew all along.
He knew all along.	What??
What??	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What?	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.	Yeah?
Yeah?	Maybe you can be his stand-in.

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.	Your doctor?
Your doctor?	Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED	She's wonderful.
CONTINUED	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
Right. Just a sec.	Okay.
Okay.	Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.	Sure, what is it?
Sure, what is it?	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.	What's up?
What's up?	It's about my salary cheques.
It's about my salary cheques.	Yes?
Yes?	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.	Really.
Really.	Yes.
Yes.	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.	It's possible.
It's possible.	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.	No. I never did, either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.	Oh?
Oh?	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.	That seems very unlikely.
That seems very unlikely.	Yes, I thought so.
Yes, I thought so.	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.	How?
How?	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.	That's true.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.	But not completely inconceivable?
But not completely inconceivable?	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.	I guess it isn't.
I guess it isn't.	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going?	Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake?	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.	You're kidding.
You're kidding.	No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?	Two more.
Two more.	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal?	Yes.
It's the last one.	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.	I guess not.
I guess not.	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.	Roger.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.	He's got a point.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.	What is it, Hal?
What is it, Hal?	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.	Sure, Dave, what's up?
Sure, Dave, what's up?	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?	Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.	You probably also know that we found them okay.
You probably also know that we found them okay.	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.	Well, don't worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.	And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?	Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.	The antenna has to be replaced.
The antenna has to be replaced.	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I am prepared to do that anyway.	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
CONTINUED	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED	Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED	Well, what is it?
CONINUED	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.	Are you coming to my party?
Are you coming to my party?	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.	When are you coming home?
When are you coming home?	In three days, darling, I hope.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.	Where is Mrs. Brown?
Where is Mrs. Brown?	She's in the bathroom.
She's in the bathroom.	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.	How many days until you come home?
How many days until you come home?	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?	Yes, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.	Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.	I'll bet it's a fortune.
And your charming little daughter?	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.	How is gregor?
How is gregor?	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.	Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.	Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.	Please, it really doesn't matter.
Please, it really doesn't matter.	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?	Yes, very pleasant.
Yes, very pleasant.	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?	Fine.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.	Yes, it's coming along very well.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
Are you quite sure?	Yes, really, thank you very much.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.	Really?
Really?	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?	That's right.
That's right.	I see.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.	Fortunately, they did.
Fortunately, they did.	Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?	Certainly.
Certainly.	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.	Any clue as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Any ideas about the colour?	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.	When do we arrive at Clavius?
When do we arrive at Clavius?	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you.	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.	I see.
I see.	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.	I will if I can, Frank.
I will if I can, Frank.	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?	True.
True.	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?	That's true.
That's true.	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?	That's true
That's true	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?

Yes, Hal, what's up?	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Yeah?	I want to pick up my car.
Name?	Hammond.
This is three years old.	Yeah, I've been busy.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.	How about chargin' the battery?
How about chargin' the battery?	That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.	Great, just great.
Yeah.	Vodka.
Vodka.	Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.	Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.	I don't give a shit who you ask.
I don't give a damn about his girl...	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.	You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile.	I ain't tired yet.
I ain't tired yet.	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.	Whaddya mean, buy?

Pay money?	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.	I never paid for it in my life.
I never paid for it in my life.	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.	He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what about me?	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
I'm candy...	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?	Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

What's the matter with my place?	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...	Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again.	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here you go, baby.	Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?	Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?	Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
How about it?	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
I hear you've got visitors.	Would you guys...
Would you guys...	No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...	You're gonna help us take him.
You're gonna help us take him.	No chance.
No chance.	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Where's ganz?	In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...	I don't think you're gonna make it.
I don't think you're gonna make it.	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.
You're done.  End of story.	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?	Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Yeah, I noticed...	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah?	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.	You're crazy.
You're crazy.	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?	I got a lot to protect.
I got a lot to protect.	Bullshit.
Bullshit.	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.	I'll think about it.
This prison gives out $400 suits?	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.	No way to start a partnership.
No way to start a partnership.	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Yeah.	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?	Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.	Luther was part of the gang?
Luther was part of the gang?	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?	I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.	Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....	I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.	I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Want to try it again?
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.
I think you better put him on ice, man.	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.	If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.	"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.	We eat when I say we eat.
We eat when I say we eat.	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...	Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.	Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict?	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.	Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.	You have a good time?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Well?	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.	This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?	If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...	But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...	You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet?	I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.	That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.	What are you talkin' about?
What are you talkin' about?	You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.	The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?	While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.	Must be billy's girl.
Must be billy's girl.	Come on.
Let's go.	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.	You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...	I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?	Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.	They saved your ass, convict.
They saved your ass, convict.	One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?
How much?	Half a million.
Half a million.	Jesus.
Just tell me about the money.	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.	He's after your money.
He's after your money.	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
We split 50-50?	Not likely, convict.
Not likely, convict.	You gonna let me keep any of it?
You gonna let me keep any of it?	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Where's the money?	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Yeah.  Right.
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.	You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.	Shit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
What?	Musta got some primo bondsman.
Musta got some primo bondsman.	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.	Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
If they don't tell me what I need to know...	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...	You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...	Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.	What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.	No class...
No class...	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?	Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.	You stay with me...
You stay with me...	No way...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Where's luther?	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.	Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?	What about Ganz?
We missed.	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."	So you took the rest of the night off...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...	You sure that's the reason?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...	Yeah. Guess not.
Yeah, I see her.	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.	Why?
Why?	Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Hey, how'd my car get here?	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
It's late, they're closing...	Don't worry about it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...	Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do I get to kiss her too?	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Hey, there she is...	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.	If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.	Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.	Partnership?
Partnership?	Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay?	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.	Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.	There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?	That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.	No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Thanks.	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.	Yeah, I read the report...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah...	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.	Jack?
Jack?	Yeah?
Yeah?	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.	I'll keep it in mind.
What the bell happened?	I lost them, that's what happened.
I lost them, that's what happened.	How did they get away?
How did they get away?	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.	You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up.	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?	I didn't have the time.
I didn't have the time.	Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
That's what you say, Cates...	Yeah.
Yeah.	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.	I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.	Shit.
Billy Bear...	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who are all these?	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.	Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?	Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.	Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.	One of  em's in the slam.
You look awful.	So do you...been a long day.
So do you...been a long day.	Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.	Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.	Doesn't look like it.
Doesn't look like it.	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?	Nothing.
Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.	What?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop...	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.	You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.	Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.	I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.	When? How?
When? How?	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded...	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?	I still don't think it's loaded.
Hey, you're right.	You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
What'd you do?	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I guess he got the message...
I guess he got the message...	Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.	Hey, you know what I really think?
Hey, you know what I really think?	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
That's the way I see it, too.	Call me later.
Call me later.	You sure you want me to?
You sure you want me to?	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...	Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.	Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, one of my favorites.	You made the front page.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...	Jack, are you okay?
Jack, are you okay?	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...	Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...	I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.	No wonder you're so popular.
No wonder you're so popular.	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.	So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?	Jack?  What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...	Jack, wait...
Jack, wait...	Just a second, that's all!
Hello.	Hi, it's me...
Hi, it's me...	Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.	Hiya, kid.
Hiya, kid.	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...	How do you know?
How do you know?	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.

Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	So what?
So what?	When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.	Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Whaddya think?	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.	Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Three more hours...	Where is he?
Where is he?	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...	Tell me.
Tell me.	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
You're impossible...	That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you?	Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...	Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
How would you know?	Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey, two days with him is enough.	That's no bull.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hey...	Shut up.
Shut up.	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.
Stall.	What do you want?
Keep stallin'.	Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they?	Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'?	Can't complain.
Can't complain.	We got a lot to talk about.
We got a lot to talk about.	Yeah, old times.
Yeah, old times.	We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?	Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther.	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-	I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.	You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...	Don't give me this, we were partners.
Don't give me this, we were partners.	Billy, go ahead, break it...
Billy, go ahead, break it...	No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.	When?
When?	I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.	You chickenshit punk...
You chickenshit punk...	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.	You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Let her go.	First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much?	This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...	Don't mess with me. How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?	Five bills.
Five bills.	Five.  On credit.
Five.  On credit.	This ain't a credit business.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.
Give it back.	Try and take it.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..	Corn-i-Lius?
Corn-i-Lius?	At your service.
What're you laughing about?	Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!	The case was stolen?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!	You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!	I'm fucked!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.	Why?  What's wrong with me?
Why?  What's wrong with me?	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...would you like a drink?	No thank you.
No thank you.	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!	They are robots!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You are a monster, Zorg!	I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?	She dropped in on me... holding this.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
I brought the girl remember?	The girl?
He's a she!	You noticed...
You noticed...	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!	So you do know her.
So you do know her.	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
They all like this in your family, father?	She's an exception..
She's an exception..	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.	I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?	"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
"It means, ""Never without my permission""."	That's what I thought.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..	What kind of mission?
What kind of mission?	We have to save the world.
We have to save the world.	Good luck..
Good luck..	Of course.
Of course.	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
What are you doing?	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.	Leeloo's in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?	When is she not in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?	That's what I'm saying.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.	One more reason to shoot first eh?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.	And then?
And then?	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Is there anything that can stop it?	Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.	Thank you, Mr. President.
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!	What is?
What is?	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
What's she doing?	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..	Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...	I didn't know your size.
They really made her...	Perfect.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Where's Leeloo?	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...	Who?
Who?	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Leeloo... is... she's...	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!	Do you love her?
Do you love her?	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!	I don't have time... I need to know.
I don't have time... I need to know.	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.	I would like to have died in peace...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...	They are... with me...
Yeah?	Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.	I was talking to the cat.
I was talking to the cat.	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
At least, the cat comes back.	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.	I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.	Don't exist bud.

Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.	Okay. Do.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.	If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's my...cousin.	Uh huh?
Uh huh?	She's from...France.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.	He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.	Don't tell him you're here.
Don't tell him you're here.	Why would I?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-	You're at Paul Owen s.
You're at Paul Owen s.	Who?
Who?	Paul Owen.
Paul Owen.	I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?	No.
No.	Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.	Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.	Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?	Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.	Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.	Does he do this all the time?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?	No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?	Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.	Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.	You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.	No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?	Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.

No, I guess it's okay.	You sure?

Don't you know this?	I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?	We were both seven in 1969.
We were both seven in 1969.	So was I.
So was I.	Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?	Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.	Well, maybe he did, huh?

His girlfriend doesn't think so.	But...has anyone seen him in London?
But...has anyone seen him in London?	Actually, yes.
Actually, yes.	Hmmm.
Hmmm.	Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...	Oh.
Oh.	Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?	What?
What?	I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-	Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-	Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Have you consulted a psychic?	No.
No.	Had his apartment been burglarized?
Had his apartment been burglarized?	No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.	I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?	No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.	That's so typical, isn't it?
That's so typical, isn't it?	It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...	Nothing.
Nothing.	People just...disappear.
People just...disappear.	The earth just opens up and swallows people.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.	Eerie. Really eerie.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.	Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?	Uh, no. There's one...down here.

"How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for ""formal questioning?"""	0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?	Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.	Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.	Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.	Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?	Not really.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?	God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.	Wait. That's not what I've got.
Wait. That's not what I've got.	What?
What?	That's not the information I've received.
That's not the information I've received.	Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

Let's see...  That you were with-	Well, I could he wrong.
Well, I could he wrong.	Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?	We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.	Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.	Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?	Great, yes, I'd like that.
Great, yes, I'd like that.	And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.	Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.	Not a big music fan, eh?
Not a big music fan, eh?	No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.	Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.	I'll be there.
No hash browns?	Not in the mood, I guess.
Not in the mood, I guess.	But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?	Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.	Suit yourself, I guess.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?	I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?	I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.	But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?	According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.	And?
And?	I've questioned him.
I've questioned him.	Marcus?
Marcus?	Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.	But Marcus denied it?
But Marcus denied it?	Yes.
Yes.	Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
I checked it out. It's clean.	Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?	Where was Marcus?
Where was Marcus?	He wasn't with Paul Owen.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.	So who was he with?
So who was he with?	He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.	Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?	I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.	Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?	I lost my job...
I lost my job...	Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?	I'm not...

Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?	What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?	Listen, what's your name?
Listen, what's your name?	Al.
Al.	Speak up. Come on.

Shhhh...it's okay.	Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.	Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.	I can't...I can't find a shelter
I can't...I can't find a shelter	You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?	I've been great. And you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?	It's...it's...all right.
It's...it's...all right.	Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?	Oh well, you know.
Oh well, you know.	And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.	Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.	Yeah, well, you're late.
Yeah, well, you're late.	Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.	We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.	Nobody goes there anymore.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?	I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?	Cecelia is, well...you know
Cecelia is, well...you know	Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.	Another Martini, Paul?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.	Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?	No, man. I'm gonna bail.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.	Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?	They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Hey, Halberstam?	Yes, Owen?
Yes, Owen?	Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?	No, Owen.
No, Owen.	Is that a raincoat?
Is that a raincoat?	Yes, it is.
You think so?	You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.	Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?	What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.	I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?	Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Is it over?	They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.	You are a fanatic.
You are a fanatic.	'Gonna wait outside.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.	"""Make"" him?"

I'm just screwed.	You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.	You don't wanna move, do you?
You don't wanna move, do you?	I can paint anywhere.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --	Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.	C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --	Then you've gotta ask him about that.
It's important.	If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.	Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.	But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.	I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.	...But?
...But?	Didn't you visit the campus?
Didn't you visit the campus?	I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.	No way. You have this -- destiny.
No way. You have this -- destiny.	C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --	Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?	You saved my life in alot of ways.
When's Brian coming for the TV?	Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That took some fun out of --	We're not gonna let it.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?	Milo! What about --?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?	That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.	"He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, ""Did you really do this just today?"" Cause I was impressed. He said ""What're you implying?"""
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
He's your boss. He's not your --	I know, I know.
I know, I know.	If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.	Isn't that -- extreme?
Isn't that -- extreme?	What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --	You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What!	Teddy was killed last night.
Teddy was killed last night.	What're you -- what?
What're you -- what?	It was a hate crime.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.	I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.	I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.	"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."
"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."	They hack into people's programs?
They hack into people's programs?	Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.	You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.	Go where? You can't get away from people like this.

Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.	...What?

Maybe I'm going too fast.	Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
It's okay. Really.	Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.

Well -- you sent for me.	Right... Right.
You really wrote this just today?	What're you implying.
What're you implying.	Nothing!
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?	I'm sure.
I'm sure.	The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
It scales, don't you think?	Definitely.

We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!"
How close are you?	What?
What?	He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.	A what?
A what?	It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.

Why were you snooping in my office?	Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.

We know all that, Exposition.	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil.
